## Hi there, I'm David

I'm a software developer from Germany, living near Augsburg. My main focus is backend development based on Python using FastAPI/Django. Also I like to improve the tools we sue while working on projects.

### See my projects

* [`nur` - as taskrunner based on `nu` shell](https://github.com/nur-taskrunner/nur): It borrows concepts from `just` and `b5` while adding the superpowers you get by using `nu`. Also see the [`nur` documentation](https://nur-taskrunner.github.io/docs/).
* [`b5` taskrunner](https://github.com/team23/b5): This is the taskrunenr I wrote before working on `nur`. It uses `bash` to define the tasks.
* [sub-pre-commit](https://github.com/ddanier/sub-pre-commit) is a `pre-commit` hook to allow using `pre-commit` in monorepos.
* Python libraries:
  - [pydantic-partial](https://github.com/team23/pydantic-partial): Allow creating partial versions of your pydantic models.
  - [pydantic-changedetect](https://github.com/team23/pydantic-changedetect): Enhance your pydantic models to track changes.
  - [pydantic-async-validation](https://github.com/team23/pydantic-async-validation): Add async validation to pydantic models. Raising normal `ValidationError`'s.
  - [pydantic-apply](https://github.com/team23/pydantic-apply): Small, but useful pydantic library to apply changes to a pydantic model, skipping validation until all changes are applied.
  - [async-signals](https://github.com/team23/async-signals): Port of the [Django signals](https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/django/dispatch), but with an async twist. Can for example be used in FastAPI projects.
  - [fastapi-module-loader](https://github.com/team23/fastapi-module-loader): Library to load all components of your FastAPI project in an organised way. Somewhat like having a Django applicatiosn with AppConfig's.
